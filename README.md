# **CatSniffer**

## Overview

CatSniffer ðŸ˜¼ is a multiprotocol, multiband device designed for sniffing, communicating, and attacking IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Shaped as a highly portable USB stick, it integrates powerful chips like **TI CC1352**, **Semtech SX1262**, and either the **RP2040** (for V3 and newer) or **Microchip SAMD21E17** (for V2 and earlier).

This device serves as a comprehensive tool for IoT security researchers, developers, and enthusiasts. CatSniffer is compatible with a wide range of software, including:

- SmartRF Packet Sniffer
- Sniffle
- zigbee2mqtt
- Z-Stack-firmware
- Ubiqua Protocol Analyzer
- Custom applications tailored to your specific needs

## Supported Technologies

CatSniffer can operate across multiple protocols:
- **LoRa**
- **Sub-1 GHz**
- **2.4 GHz**

Inspired by the work of Michael Ossmann and tools like the YardStick, GreatFET, HackRF, and Ubertooth, CatSniffer pays homage to the open-source hardware community.
